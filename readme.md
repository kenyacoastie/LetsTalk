The social platform application, built using Redux, React.js, Firebase, HTML, and CSS. 

The main purpose for building this application for me was to learn Redux and how to use
Google Firebase for user authentication and managing the application database. Plus, it's a new 
experience building a social platform application. I've followed many tutorials while building this app (listed below). 

The general approach taken was first to design the database structure for the app. Then, to build 
the single state tree (store) of the application, and based on that, to describe all possible changes in the application state by
 writing actions, and then, reducers. After connecting the Redux to the React viewlayer, each component was connected to 
  Redux through the routes and `connect` function. 
  
The app has 4 pages - Home Page, Posts Feed Page, Profile Page, and Post Reply Page.
